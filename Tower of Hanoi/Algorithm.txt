Base Case:
  If there is only one disk (n = 1), move it directly from the source peg to the destination peg.
Recursive Case:
  Move n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg, using the destination peg as an intermediate.
  Move the nth (largest) disk from the source peg to the destination peg.
  Move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg, using the source peg as an intermediate.
