1. Initialize the Graph

Define the vertices and adjacency list of the graph.

Define a set of available colors.



2. Define a Constraint Function (promise)

Check if a color can be assigned to a vertex without violating the constraint that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.



3. Define a Function to Assign Colors (color_vertex)

Iterate through available colors and assign the first valid color.



4. Assign Colors to Each Vertex

Loop through all vertices and assign colors based on constraints.



5. Print the Color Mapping of Each Vertex
