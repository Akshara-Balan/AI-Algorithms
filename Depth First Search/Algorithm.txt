1. Initialize an empty list visited to keep track of visited nodes.


2. Initialize a stack frontier to store nodes that need to be explored.


3. Take input for the start node (st) and goal node (gt).


4. Add the start node to visited and frontier.


5. While the stack (frontier) is not empty:

Remove the last node from frontier (LIFO principle).

Print the current node to track traversal.

If the current node is the goal node (gt), exit the loop.

Otherwise, for each neighbor of the current node:

If the neighbor has not been visited, add it to visited and frontier.




6. The search continues until the goal node is found or all nodes are explored.
