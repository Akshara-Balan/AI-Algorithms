1. Initialize an empty list visited to keep track of visited nodes.


2. Initialize a queue neigh to store the nodes to be explored.


3. Take input for the start node (st) and goal node (gt).


4. Add the start node to visited and neigh.


5. While the queue (neigh) is not empty:

Remove the first node from neigh (FIFO principle).

If the current node is the goal node (gt), exit the loop.

Otherwise, for each neighbor of the current node:

If the neighbor has not been visited, add it to visited and neigh.




6. Print the visited nodes, which represent the path.
