BFS(graph, start, goal):
    visited ← empty list

    Add start to visited
    Add start to neigh

    While neigh is not empty:

        If key is equal to goal:

        For each neighbor in graph[key]:
            If neighbor is not in visited:
                Add neighbor to visited
                Enqueue neighbor into neigh

    Print "PATH:", visited
