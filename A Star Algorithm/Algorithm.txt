A* (A-star) is a pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm that finds the shortest path from a start node to a goal node. It uses a combination of g(n) (the cost to reach a node) and h(n) (a heuristic estimating the cost from the node to the goal).
Algorithm Steps:

    Initialize:
        Create an open list (nodes to explore) and a closed list (visited nodes).
        Add the start node to the open list with cost 0.

    Loop until the goal is reached or no nodes remain:
        Pick the node with the lowest f(n) = g(n) + h(n) from the open list.
        If this node is the goal, return the path.
        Move the node from open list to closed list.

    Expand neighbors:
        For each neighbor, calculate g(n), the actual cost from the start.
        Compute f(n) = g(n) + h(n).
        If the neighbor has a lower cost path, update it in the open list.

    Repeat until the goal is reached or the open list is empty.
