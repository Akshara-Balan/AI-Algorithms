DFS(graph, start, goal):
    visited ← empty list
    frontier ← empty stack

    Add start to visited
    Add start to frontier

    While frontier is not empty:
        key ← pop last element from frontier
        Print key

        If key is equal to goal:
            Break

        For each neighbor in graph[key]:
            If neighbor is not in visited:
                Add neighbor to visited
                Push neighbor onto frontier
