Initialize the jugs:

Set jug1 = 0 and jug2 = 0 (both jugs start empty).
Set steps = 0 to count the number of steps.
Perform operations until the goal is reached:

If jug1 is empty, fill it completely.
If jug2 is full, empty it.
Otherwise, pour water from jug1 to jug2 until jug1 is empty or jug2 is full.
Increment the step counter.
Check if the goal is reached:

If the target jug (jug1 or jug2) has the goal amount, stop.
Output the sequence of steps taken to reach the goal.
